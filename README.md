# :boat: Build instructions 
Dependencies:
```
Eigen 3.3
OpenCV 3.4
Ceres 1.14
Sophus 1.0
```
Note: this code has been build and tested on Ubuntu 18.04, but it should compile for newer versions of Ubuntu.

## ðŸ“¥ Dataset 
You may need to download nuScenes dataset (radar) from [nutonomy/nuscenes-devkit](https://github.com/nutonomy/nuscenes-devkit).

## :taxi: Examples 

1. preprocess [Nuscenes dataset](https://www.nuscenes.org/) to get loop closure cases and compensate for doppler effect in each radar submap.
```bash
cd ./preprocess
python search_for_loopclosure.py -n PATH_TO_NUSCENES
python list_seq.py
```
2. metric localization process
```bash
cd ~/DCRML
mkdir build
cd ./build
cmake ../DCRML
make
./DCRML
```
