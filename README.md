# Metric localization performance

# Build instructions
Dependencies:
```
Eigen 3.3
OpenCV 3.4
Ceres 1.14
Sophus 1.0
```
Note: this code has been build and tested on Ubuntu 18.04, but it should compile for newer versions of Ubuntu.

## Examples

1. preprocess [Nuscenes dataset](https://www.nuscenes.org/) to get loop closure cases and compensate for doppler effect in each radar submap.
```
python search_for_loopclosure.py PATH_TO_NUSCENES
python list_seq.py
```
2. metric localization process
```
cd ~/DCRML
mkdir build
cd ./build
cmake ../DCRML
make
./DCRML
```
